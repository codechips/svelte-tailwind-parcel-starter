# svelte-tailwind-parcel-starter

Svelte.js starter pack with [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/),
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). Yummy mummy!

The starter pack also includes
[tailwindcss-font-inter](https://github.com/semencov/tailwindcss-font-inter)
plugin for Tailwind plus Prettier and Eslint plugins with opinionated settings.

This is the code for my article [Svelte + Tailwind + Parcel = Awesome!](https://codechips.me/svelte-tailwind-parcel-awesome/).

I take no responsibility if you get paid less because you have become more
productive with these awesome tools and suddenly started getting things done
faster.
